# Prework - *MyFirstProject*

Submitted by: **Aleksandra Avramenko**

**MyFirstProject** is an app that allows the user to press the button to change the color of the background as well as rotate the spinning wheel to view the photos of different academic institutions. The app also has three labels that contain my name, the name of the college where I study, and my dream job.

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button

## Notes

One of the challenges was to connect the spinning wheel to the image block. I had to implement dictionary there. Another problem was to speed up the gif.
